# Sub-Vector Benchmark
It's a **single-thread** benchmark tool that computes the maximum sequentially sum of a vector.

This code needs and works on multiple **.csv files**.
All these files must be named as `FilenameNum.csv` and they must contains integer values on a single line, each of these values should be separated by a comma or a semi-column (The code auto-recognise the separator).

There are some example files in this repository, under **Sample Arrays** folder.
